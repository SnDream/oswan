Gameblabla's Oswan
=======================

Gameblabla's Oswan is a Wonderswan/Wonderswan color, based on OswanJ by bird_may_nike and Oswan by Alekmaul.

It can play most Wonderswan games properly.

It used to be based on Alekmaul's Oswan port but significant modifications were done to it.

This fork is also even more accurate than upstream, while still being faster and portable : 

Games are now playing at the proper speed, games like Klonoa and Beatmania now sound closer to real hardware.

Currently the source code is being revamped and is SDL-only for now.

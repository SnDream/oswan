Oswan+ by SnDream
======================

Oswan+ is a fork of Gameblabla's Oswan, aimed at a better experience on the RS-90.

This fork tries to improve the speed, supports large ROMs (4M+), simple LCD icon emulation, and some other features.

The key into the emulator menu:

First, "Emu Menu" (if configured). Second, "Remap Switch" + "WS START" (if the combination is legal). Finally, Select + Start key.

Press Select (Horizontal) / L + R (Vertical) into emulator menu in default.

Gameblabla's Oswan
=======================

Gameblabla's Oswan is a Wonderswan/Wonderswan color, based on OswanJ by bird_may_nike and Oswan by Alekmaul.

It can play most Wonderswan games properly.

It used to be based on Alekmaul's Oswan port but significant modifications were done to it.

This fork is also even more accurate than upstream, while still being faster and portable : 

Games are now playing at the proper speed, games like Klonoa and Beatmania now sound closer to real hardware.

Currently the source code is being revamped and is SDL-only for now.

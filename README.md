====================
Gameblabla's Oswan
====================

Gameblabla's Oswan is a Wonderswan/Wonderswan color emulator made by bird_may_nike.
It can play most Wonderswan games properly.

It used to be based on Alekmaul's Oswan port but the numerous issues it introduced
(including incompatibility with some games) pushed me to convert everything over OswanJ SVN.

Kinnikuman now works and the emulator also has a slightly better CPU core from NomadSwan,
the old one is still available for testing.

=======================
Gameblabla's Oswan
=======================

Gameblabla's Oswan is a Wonderswan/Wonderswan color, based on OswanJ by bird_may_nike and Oswan by Alekmaul.

It can play most, if not all Wonderswan games properly. (except some B&W games)


It used to be based on Alekmaul's Oswan port but the numerous issues it introduced

(including incompatibility with some games) pushed me to convert everything over OswanJ SVN.

This fork is also even more accurate than upstream : 

Games are now playing at the proper speed.


The CPU core comes from NomadSwan (GPLv2 or later).

Somes changes were made in order to remove useless code.


A stripped-down version of Minizip is provided as well. 

Minizip is licensed under a 3-clause BSD license.

==============
COMPATIBILITY
==============

All known Wonderswan Color games are known to play properly,

with no graphical or audio glitches.

This fork however still has some trouble with some games :
- Pocket Fighter (Graphical Glitches)
- Klonoa (Graphical Glitches, Scratchy voices)
- Beatmania (Scratchy sound at moment, fine in-game)

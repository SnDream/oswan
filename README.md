OSWAN
=======

Port of Oswan for TI nspire (CX).
GUI is coming from the GCW0 version of Oswan by Alekmaul.

Oswan is a Wonderswan/Wonderswan color emulator made by bird_may_nike.
It can play most Wonderswan games properly.

Most games on TI nspire can be played at a decent speed with some frameskip.
(Speedhacks currently only works on x86, due to crc giving different results on different architectures)

CONTROLS

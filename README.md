====================
Gameblabla's Oswan
====================

Gameblabla's Oswan is a Wonderswan/Wonderswan color, 
based on OswanJ by bird_may_nike and Oswan by Alekmaul.
It can play most, if not all Wonderswan games properly.

It used to be based on Alekmaul's Oswan port but the numerous issues it introduced
(including incompatibility with some games) pushed me to convert everything over OswanJ SVN.

The CPU core from NomadSwan.
Somes changes were made in order to remove useless code.

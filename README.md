OSWAN
=======

Port of Oswan for TI nspire (CX).
GUI is coming from the GCW0 version of Oswan by Alekmaul.

Oswan is a Wonderswan/Wonderswan color emulator made by bird_may_nike.
It can play most Wonderswan games proprely.

This fork is less accurate and focus on speed instead.
As a result, there are lots of hacks and some games don't play proprely
but games run much faster on TI nspire.

Most games on TI nspire can be played at a decent speed with some frameskip.

====================
Gameblabla's Oswan
====================

Gameblabla's Oswan is a Wonderswan/Wonderswan color, 
based on OswanJ by bird_may_nike and GCW0 Oswan by Alekmaul.
It can play most Wonderswan games properly.

It used to be based on Alekmaul's Oswan port but the numerous issues it introduced
(including incompatibility with some games) pushed me to convert everything over OswanJ SVN.

The emulator also has a slightly better CPU core from NomadSwan,
but the old one is still available for testing.

I'm trying to clean up the code base.
I have removed support for the PSP (too slow anyways for Oswan) and the SyllableOS-specific code
I attemped to make menu.c look nicer but i'm still not fully satisfied though. (look at the load_file function !)
I have removed the hacks.c and md5.c files... it never worked properly anyways.

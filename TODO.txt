- Proper way to identify roms
CRC checks and buffering checking can't be trusted because they return different values on each architecture.
This is what prevents some games from running since the roms can't be properly detected.
(See WsRomPatch())

Which means i can't warn users from roms that could potentially crash the emulator !
We need an alternative that could work on TI Nspire.
(Check the header ? (if there's even one) Use MD5 instead ?)

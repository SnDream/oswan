Improve the code
==================
It became a mess. (seriously)
The sound code need to be better seperated. 
The input code really needs some improvements, there's a lot of duplication.

Sound code is broken
====================
Someone else added it to Oswan (alekmaul) but it's horrible and the buffer will run out after a while, before being refilled again.
Unfortunately, i'm totally not familiar with this stuff. It could be ported to PortAudio but the SDL audio code
will need to be improved too because SDL is the only audio library on some platforms (KolibriOS, Syllable etc...)

Proper 32-bits support
=======================
I need to add support for 32-bits output.
Palette code needs to be adjusted for RGBA 32-bits.
Look at emu/WSRender.c and SetPalette function for more info.

Menu code
==========
The menu code needs to be more flexible accross resolutions, without the use of something like SDL_ttf.
Perhaps use bitmap fonts combined with software scaling ?

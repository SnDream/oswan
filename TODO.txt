- Proper 32-bits support
On Linux, if the bpp is different from the display, it will be converted but there will be a significant drop in speed.
The only problem is the palette : it is not properly converted to 32 bits and it's DIFFICULT !
Look at emu/WSRender.c and SetPalette function for more info.
